### Recursion
#### Stack 
Stack is the data structure (FIFO), This data structure was used mainly for storing memory
When function was called they will push to stack, and they this fuction finised it will be removed from this stack

Stack and Heap was stored in RAM
1. Linear Recursion / De qui tuyen tinh

A linear recursive function is a function that only makes a single call to itself each time the function runs
2. Binary Recursive / De qui nhi phan

Some recursive functions don't just have one call to themself, they have two (or more). Functions with two recursive calls are referred to as binary recursive functions.

### Matrix( 2 dimensional array)
1. Check follow the row
2. Check follow the column
3. Check follow the border
The first row a[0][j], the last row a[n-1][j] , a[i][0] & a[i][-1] if  0 <i < n-1 (n is the number of rows )
4. Check follow principal diagonal
We will loop for per row : and get matrix[i][i] (i is the index of current row)
5. Check follow secondary diagonal
We will loop for per row : and get matrix[i][n-i-1] (i is the index of current row, n is the the number of rows)
